# ðŸ”„ Versioning

---
As the needs of businesses evolve and technology advances, changes to APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are inevitable. To effectively manage these changes, we have decided to use API versioning for Lucidya API.

## Lucidya API's Current Version

As of now, the current version of the Lucidya API is **Version 1 (V1)**.

```json

https://api.lucidya.com/monitors_list
https://api.lucidya.com/widgets

```

As we continue to improve and update the Lucidya API, we will introduce new versions. Rest assured, we will provide ample notice and updated documentation with each new version to ensure a smooth transition for all users.

!!! tip "ðŸ’¡ Remember"
    The goal of API versioning is to ensure that your experience with our system remains seamless, even as we make improvements and updates. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in this matter.
